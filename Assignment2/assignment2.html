    <h4>What are Conservation Areas?</h4>
    <p><em>Conservation Areas </em>are places which are preserved due to their biodiversity or
        ecological signicance.Human activities have negatively impacted many ecosystems and earth as a whole.Global
        warming, pollution on multiple levels, climate changes, extinction of many species are few of the issues. It
        has, therefore, resulted in governments taking measures to combat these issues by establishment of protected 
        areas. The flora and fauna in these areas are  protected by the restriction on human activities such as 
        poaching, cutting trees and use of fossil fuels.</p>
        <br>


    <h4>Types of Conservation areas</h4>
    <p>The term <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area" target="_blank">'protected area'</a> includes forest areas,water bodies
         and extends over many nations irrespective of the borders for the purpose of protection of species.
        There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 
        2010) which is almost 10 to 15 percent of the world's land area.</p>
    

    <h4><b>Benefits of Conservation areas</b></h4>
        <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/giant-panda" target="_blank"><img src="images/panda1.jpg" alt="Giant Panda" height="250" width="320" 
        style="float:right;"></a>
    <p>There are numerous advantages of setting up such <i>'protected areas'</i>.The benefits range not ony for the various species growing in these but also to us humans.</p>

    <h5>Protection of Species</h5>
    <p>Many species of plants and animals need a specific ecosystem to grow and propagate and establishment of conservation areas act as a haven for the species 
        driven to extinction or endangered status. This is exemplified by the changing of the status of 'Giant panda'
        from endangered to vulnerable.This feat was achieved by intense conservation efforts by the  governments and is an evidence of the effectiveness of 
        conservation areas in the preventing a species from extinction.</p>

    <h5>Reducing Carbon-dioxide Levels</h5>
    <p>The increase in human usage of fossil fuels and indiscriminate release of poisonous and noxious gases from different industries has resulted in the levels of 
         Carbon-dioxide  to increase considerably and caused global temperatures to rise.The preservation of forests in the protected areas help in 
        reducing the carbon concentrations on the Earth, thereby delaying the global warming and climate change crisis.</p>

    <h5>Connecting to Nature</h5>
    <p>Some conservation areas allow limited entry to humans,allowing certain recreational activities like kayaking,camping,boating and serve as a place for
         humans to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and enjoy connecting with nature in all its glory.This not only improves the mood of the people
          but also instills a positive attitude towards environment and how we can co-exist with nature peacefully.</p>

    <h5>Practical Reasons</h5>
    <p>Another reason to protect the ecosystem is a more practical one.We humans, are part of this ecosystem and are dependent
        on nature for air, water, soil for our crops, lands to rear animals and grow crops for food. The aggressive use of human
        activities such as poaching would upset the balance of the nature, thereby creating numerous issues such as flooding, 
        polluted air and food shortage.</p>

    <h4>Challenges in maintaining Conservation Areas</h4>
        <img src="images/logging.jpg" alt="group oflogs" width="320" height="250" style="float:right;">
    <p>The success and maintenance of conservation areas require not only support from the government but also from the public and 
        communities near it. The segreggation of land for protection in the face of growing land shortage may create opposition from
        the people.The mounting pressure from oil and mining industries are all challenges to the preservation of conservation areas.</p>

    <h5>Inadequate inclusion of ecosystems</h5>
    <p>Poor representation of habitats
        Many ecosystems are not adequately protected due to the less importance given to those ecosystems such as certain lakes and oceans.</p>

    <h5>Scarcity of Money</h5>
    <p>This scarcity of money is more in developing countries and for protection of water bodies. There is a requirement to find new ways to establish networks to 
        source enough funds for protected areas.</p>

    <h5>Human Invasion</h5>
    <p>The activities of logging, poaching , mining, and encroachment by human settlements and agriculture threaten the areas. Other activities which are a menace
        to the areas are pollution, uch as those leading to pollution, climate change, and the growth of alien species.</p>

    <h4>What can we do?</h4>
        <img src="images/ennvmt.jpg" alt="globe in a field" width="320" height="250" style="float:right;">
    <p>We are the most intelligent species on this planet and we can do a lot in contributing towards the preservation of ecosystems.</p>

    <h5>Gaining Knowledge of Environmental Issues</h5>
    <p>We can do this by being aware of the consequences of human activities on nature and can also become educators for the next generation.</p>

    <h5>Incorporating environment-protection activities in daily life</h5>
    <p>There are a lot of measures that we can incorporate in our daily lives such as not interfering in wildlife habitats especially nesting areas of birds,ensuring that 
            pets do not disturb these areas,supporting local government programs that protect habitats and carpooling more often.</p>
